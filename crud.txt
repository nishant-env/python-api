crud in api is an acronym given to 4 important operations:
a) Create
http_method: Post
path_convention: /posts (plural)
fast_api_decorator_implementation: @app.post("/posts")

b) Read
http_method: Get
path_convention: /posts (plural) or /posts/:id
fast_api_decorator_implementation: @app.post("/posts") or @app.post("/posts/{id}")

c) Update
The main difference between put and patch is:
put: All the fields needs to be passed even if a single field is required to be changed
patch: Only the required field can be passed

http_method: Put/ Patch
path_convention: /posts/:id
fast_api_decorator_implementation: @app.put("/posts/{id}") or @app.patch("/posts/{id}")


d) Delete
http_method: Delete
path_convention: /posts/:id
